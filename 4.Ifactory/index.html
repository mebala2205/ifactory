             <p>
                There more visual freedom in parallax website design. Rather than focusingon block style information architecture,<br>
                 you can create refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or beatiful photography,<br>
                that act as a continum,ultimately inspiring users to scroll further down the page.

             <p>mobiles and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites. it's now less about clicking <br>
                and more about scrolling, swiping and tapping. long crolling websites take away the barrier of complex<br>
                 navigation, providing a resposive, user friendly experience for mobile users</p>

            <p>
                parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor website browser, 
                as it forces busineeses to convey<br>
                their message and vision into one dynamic web design page.

            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
                these days, scrolling is so simple that it's become an instinctive action, 
                whereas clicking through to another<br>
                page requires though and motivation. a single page website allows user
                to identify their purpose on the<br>
                website quicker, than needing to sift through multiple pages.

            <h3>LONG SCROLL: </h3>
            <h2>YOU NEED TO BE SEARCH ENGINE SAVVY </h2>
            <p>One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that 
                they are not SEO friendly. why?<br> when you limit the number of pages
                on you website,google has fewer pages to index and <br>negatively impacts
                your standing on the search engine results page (SERP). 
                luckily there are ways<br> around this </p>

        <!-- Load Times -->
        <div class="slower">
            <h3>SLOWER LOAD TIMES</h3>
            <p>50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds.
              so the more high resolution imagery and animations you include, <br>
              the longer it takes to load the page. when writing this article, ,<br>
              we tested some popular websites, and found that the ones with complex 
              visuals took up to 30 seconds to load on<br>
              a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll
              websites loaded within a few seconds.</p>
        </div>
         <!-- Navigation -->
         <div class="awakard">
             <h3>AWKWARD NAVIGATION </h3>
             <p>instead of hitting the "back" button, users must scroll back up the page<br>
                which can be frustrating for users who want to refer back to a certain element.<br>
                an easy way around 
                this is to include top navigation and have each element anchored to a category or section. </p>
